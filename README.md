# Kmeans-Cluster-App
The kmeans cluster app allows the user the ability to import their own data and use machine learning to find the optimal number of groups in which to cluster the data. The app then clusters the data into the select number of groups. The user can then add a new row of data and the app will automatically sort the variable into the right group. This app has many uses. An example might be to use the app to sort students in a classroom into ability groups. Set the number of groups you would like. Input a dataset with the select students and their relevant quantitative variables like test scores and allow the app to sort the students accordingly.
